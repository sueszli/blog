here's a little shower thought:

imagine a simple, fair and perfectly meritocratic parallel universe in which:

- **employers:** companies hire algorithmically. you are hired solely by supply/demand and a score that's a perfect representation of your competence.

- **employees:** everyone is utilitarian, rational, self-interested and can achieve happiness just by maximizing their earnings: people are not picky about the job they get, as long as it pays well. a lawyer would be happier working as a plumber if the pay is better, even if it's less prestigious, exciting or involves physical labor.

to game this system you'd go for the highest-paying job within your reach and do just enough to meet the requirements.

so why doesn't this happen in the real world?

because hiring is complex and everyone has a unique utility function. people also try to find personal fulfillment, happiness, excitement, prestige, etc. in their jobs.

what about you? what are you optimizing for? what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?

# compensation vs. interestingness

![](./assets/competition.png)

compensation and interestingness both increase the competition you'll be facing for a job:

- a) if you're optimizing for compensation, you should avoid competition by doing something in high demand that most people avoid (ie. blue collar jobs, cobol programming).

- b) if you're optimizing for personal fulfillment, you can avoid competition by delaying your earnings (ie. by studying more, working for a non-profit).

to clarify:

- supply/demand dynamics don't influence your compensation but your likelihood of success. for example: you can expect professional athletes and celebrities to earn a lot more than caretakers and nurses although their domain is oversaturated.

- competence and compensation don't necessarily correlate. a task can be extremely difficult but pay worse and vice versa.

# personal fit

another dimension to consider is your personal fit. it's a combination of the following components [^fitdump]:

- career capital = skills, connections, credentials.
- impact = solving important problems with the right methods. your job satisfaction will grow over time as you get better and others start appreciating you more.
- supportive conditions = engagement, colleagues, basic needs.
- personal fit = how well it fits you (this is like a multiplier to the sum of the components above).

one aspect of the personal fit that stands out to me is impact.

based on 80,000 hours' career reviews [^demanddump], the most impactful jobs are mostly in the following fields:

- **data & statistics:** machine learning, statistical modeling, forecasting, data based decision governance, ai alignment, explainability, fairness, privacy, security, ethics, etc.
- **cyber security:** privacy, integrity, availability, confidentiality, etc.
- **computer engineering:** especially for ai hardware
- **geopolitics, governance:** policy, regulation, law, etc.
- **biosecurity:** preventing, detecting, responding to biological threats

in general picking a career specialization is a tough choice and just blindly chasing the next hottest trend [^gartner] isn't a sustainable strategy.
