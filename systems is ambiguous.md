# the term "systems" is actually ambiguous

a "systems researcher" or "systems engineer" can mean very different things depending on whom you ask.

in academia, the term "systems" can refer to (also see: [acm classification](https://cran.r-project.org/web/classifications/ACM.html)):

- "computer systems organization": managing loosely coupled computing resources.
- "operating systems": working close to the kernel.

but most often, people refer to the latter.

in the industry, there's a distinction between:

- "distributed systems engineers": these professionals are typically backend web architects/system designers who also code.

     - other job titles: cloud architect, devops engineer, backend developer.
     - responsibilities include task orchestration, distributed computing, data replication, load balancing management, system performance monitoring, and socket programming.

- "systems engineers": managing a company's on-premises infrastructure or working on low-level software close to the os.

     - other job titles: system administrator, network engineer, systems programmer, network administrator.
     - responsibilities include network programming, working on os-level communication, data transfer management, and ensuring network security.

some argue that labeling those who write software for managing distributed systems as "systems engineers" is incorrect.

this has been debated on stack overflow and reddit due to golang being described as a "systems programming language", although it's garbage collected and primarily used for writing web servers:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/73pe61/what_does_this_author_mean_by_golang_is_a_systems/

again: the term "systems" is ambiguous. identifying as a "systems" researcher while writing web backends (or even frontends) might be annoying to some, but it's technically not incorrect.

it's important to determine the specific type of systems research that interests you, understand the career prospects (having an industry backup plan if aiming for an academic position), and know the job's nature before starting your research.
