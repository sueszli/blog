anserini wraps lucene.

pyserini wraps lucene and faiss, so it provides both vector search and inverted indexes.

but it turns out that lucene (since a recent release) can (additionally to inverted indexes) also support hnsw indexes for dense vector search. this while being reasonably effective. but thereâ€™s a catch: due to weird design choices, to do hnsw indexes requires training models based on cosine similarity in lucene.

this paper:

1. demonstrates that lucene can be used for both dense and sparse vectors
2. compares lucene and faiss for dense vectors
