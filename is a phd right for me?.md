# introduction

it’s important to be deliberate and data driven when thinking about your career choices.

ask yourself, "is pursuing a ph.d. the right choice for me?"

the following tips thought-provoking tips from jimmy lin’s course “asecs” [^1] are a great starting point for some introspection before we start digging into the numbers.

1. **recognise that there are multiple definitions of success and multiple ways to succeed.**

   - set clear goals. define what success means to you by creating your own "utility function" and "success metrics":

     - traditional measures: like total compensation (in the industry) or recognition in the academic community.
     - personal benchmarks: fulfillment, personal and professional growth, freedom, and authority over others.

   - avoid thinking in extremes. consider unconventional paths like writing industry experience papers or using a ph.d. to test business ideas before fully committing.

2. **understand that choices come with opportunity costs.**

   - consider time and money: years spent pursuing a ph.d. or being unemployed mean missing out on paychecks.
   - risk of overspecialization: too much study may make you overqualified for certain positions.
   - mental strain: the competitive nature of academia could overwhelm or exhaust you.

3. **accept the role of skill as well as luck.**

   - no academic degree guarantees success; it only improves your chances if you put in the effort.
   - each ph.d. experience differs due to various factors such as research field, advisors, institution reputation, and location (european ph.d.s are shorter).

4. **think about distributions vs. samples.**

   - be data driven. don't base decisions solely on conversations with successful individuals due to survivorship bias.

5. **reflect on the differences between normative vs. positive approaches.**

   - normative: is your decision influenced by societal norms, personal values, or cultural expectations?
   - positive: does your chosen path offer tangible benefits like career growth, knowledge acquisition, or personal development?
