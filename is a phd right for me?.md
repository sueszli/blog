it’s important to be deliberate and data driven when thinking about your career choices.

ask yourself, "is pursuing a ph.d. the right choice for me?".

the following thought-provoking tips from jimmy lin’s course “asecs” [^1] are a great starting point for some introspection before we start digging into the numbers.

1. **recognise that there are multiple definitions of success and multiple ways to succeed.**

   - set clear goals. define what success means to you by creating your own "utility function" and "success metrics":

     - traditional measures: like total compensation (in the industry) or recognition in the academic community.
     - personal benchmarks: fulfillment, personal and professional growth, freedom, and authority over others.

   - avoid thinking in extremes. consider unconventional paths like writing industry experience papers or using a ph.d. to test business ideas before fully committing.

2. **understand that choices come with opportunity costs.**

   - consider time and money: years spent pursuing a ph.d. or being unemployed mean missing out on paychecks.
   - risk of overspecialization: too much study may make you overqualified for certain positions.
   - mental strain: the competitive nature of academia could overwhelm or exhaust you.

3. **accept the role of skill as well as luck.**

   - no academic degree guarantees success; it only improves your chances if you put in the effort.
   - each ph.d. experience differs due to various factors such as research field, advisors, institution reputation, and location (european ph.d.s are shorter).

4. **think about distributions vs. samples.**

   - be data driven. don't base decisions solely on conversations with successful individuals due to survivorship bias.

5. **reflect on the differences between normative vs. positive approaches.**

   - normative: is your decision influenced by societal norms, personal values, or cultural expectations?
   - positive: does your chosen path offer tangible benefits like career growth, knowledge acquisition, or personal development?

let's start by exploring the first tip and choosing an arbitrary success metric to demonstrate how data-driven decision making would work in practice.

<br><br>

# our metric of choice: total compensation

to be data-driven, we need measurable metrics. however, determining personal success metrics for a career is really hard. here are reasons why i think it's difficult:

- most people don’t know their own metrics.

  it takes a lot of introspection to figure out what you want in your career. personal desires can be overshadowed by societal expectations and wrong assumptions about potential rewards.

- most people don’t like talking about their metrics.

  some are motivated by curiosity and growth, while others are competitive. people may fear being judged for their desires.

- metrics change throughout life.

  with experience, needs change. ie. more experienced individuals might desire personal fulfillment over financial compensation.

the personal metrics we use are basically assumptions based on our intuition, so we should treat them that way.

even if we understand our personal values, desires, and success measures right away, most of them are qualitative (like your well-being) and are harder to measure accurately, although many see them as more important.

that’s why a lot of research focuses on popular, easy-to-measure success metrics like:

- **total compensation:** it’s harder to measure than you might think because it's not just about money. people can get paid in stock options, time off, or reduced workloads, which all contribute to work-life balance. sometimes, they can also use money that they don’t have direct access to, like grant money / funds from investors.

- **outreach and influence/recognition:** this measures how many people you reach and how your work affects them. it's easier to quantify in industries through things like monthly active users or click-through rates. in academia, it might be measured through the number of publications or citations you have (h-index, total citations, etc.) although this is controversial.

to keep things simple, let's focus on total compensation. this brings us to the research question:

> “does getting a phd increase how much money i make compared to someone who doesn’t have a phd?”.

this question is different from where we started (“is a phd right for me?”), but exploring this question serves as a good example of how to our approach can be applied to other questions.

keep in mind that this is just one of many possible metrics and not the primary reason why most computer science ph.d. students pursue their degrees [^2] [^3] [^4].

# academia: a labor of love

the computing research association's "taulbee survey" [^5] offers key insights into our query:

> “The CRA Taulbee Survey is the principal source of information on the […] employment of Ph.D.s in […] computer science […] and in providing salary […] data […] in North America.“

here are the essential findings:

- **around 70% of ph.d. graduates move into non-academic roles**:

  in total (both inside and outside the usa), 69.5% of ph.d. holders pursue careers outside academia.

- **only 7% secure tenure positions**:

  there are very few tenure positions compared to the number of ph.d. holders [^6]. the scarcity of tenure positions persists even as the number of ph.d. graduates increases. moreover, the allocation of tenure positions isn’t even across different research fields. it leans towards areas that align better with abstract or better-funded tasks like data analysis, ai, or security. this trend is influenced by several factors, including the school attended [^7] and the race and gender [^8] of the individuals. it highlights that research institutions don't solely operate based on merit but are also influenced by politics and nepotism.

  keep in mind that salaries in non-tenure academic positions have always been significantly lower compared to industry positions available even to computer science undergraduates or master's degree holders, even outside big tech.

  additionally to get a tenure-track position it is increasingly necessary to do one or more post-docs first, meaning you face even more time with very low pay.

- **over 65% of ph.d. pursuits might be motivated by immigration**:

  approximately 66.9% of computer science ph.d.s were awarded to immigrants or nonresident aliens, suggesting that for many, a ph.d. was a pathway to american citizenship via the o1 visa.

  it's noteworthy that 33.1% of the remaining ph.d. holders are non-immigrants, of which 20.1% are white.

- **47.2-61.5% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry**:

  assuming these positions yield similar earnings as non-research roles, there arises a clear skill mismatch. ph.d. holders are predominantly trained for research tasks due to the nature of academia, which emphasizes novelty and competitive technical writing.

one should also factor in the probability of not completing a ph.d. program in the first place (ie. 35% of computer science students at the university of duke [^9]).

in conclusion, it becomes evident that chasing a tenured position in academia is statistically an unrealistic dream. thus, we must reframe our research question once again:

> “does getting a phd increase how much money i make compared to someone who doesn’t have a phd _in the north american industry_?”.

this leads us to the next section.

# beyond the ivory tower of academia: phd industry earnings

understanding career opportunities for ph.d. holders in the industry, the non-profit organization "80000 hours" offers insights about job prospects and risks. before delving into statistics, it's worthwhile to explore these details.

i highly recommend exploring this resource yourself: https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/computer-science-phd/

the most critical risk factors identified are:

- **massive opportunity cost:**

  obtaining a computer science ph.d. typically takes longer than expected, often spanning six years or sometimes more than 10. the duration depends on your research area, advisor, and institution. the ph.d. program lacks specific guidelines for progress or time management.

  you'll sacrifice nearly a decade of potential earnings and career growth in the industry, which could amount to over a million dollars in lost income for most computer science ph.d. students.

  it's important to note that european ph.d.s, which mandate a master's degree beforehand, are notably shorter than american ph.d. programs. they often last only 3-4 years and, in some cases, offer a decent salary and encourage internships in the industry.

- **skill mismatch:**

  ph.d.s focus on research rather than engineering or product development. they suit research roles in the industry (of which only about 50% secure positions), or fields like data analytics, machine learning, security, and cryptography. however, they might not prepare you for most other job roles.

  additionally, the skills gained during a ph.d. might not align with industry demand. the academic community's interests often differ significantly from industry needs. consequently, even if a ph.d. enhances earnings, you might spend time on tasks loosely connected to your desired job.

the most significant benefits identified are:

- **access to industry research and leadership roles:**

  while a bachelor's or master's degree may not be the best way to prepare for industry jobs, they're usually the minimum requirement.

  similarly, a phd is often a must for high-level research and leadership roles in big companies. for these competitive positions, a phd is a hard requirement, and it's unlikely that you'll be considered without one.

  a phd opens up the door to these roles but is not a guarantee. it's a necessary but not sufficient condition.

  and only within these roles does a phd become a worthwhile investment outside of academia.

now, we understand which industry positions best align with a ph.d., where a ph.d. is an absolute requirement, and the financial opportunity cost involved in pursuing a ph.d.

given this context, let's delve into the numbers.

<br>

the data from websites like glassdoor and payscale were very wrong about salary information. instead, other sources provide a clearer picture of salaries in the tech industry.

- **levels.fyi**[^10] is a significant survey site for computer science jobs. it's one of the most extensive databases available. according to their data from 2022, the median pay for tech jobs in san francisco is $234,000 per year, and in washington d.c., it's $148,000, placing it at the 10th position. overall, _tech jobs range between $160,000 to $210,000 in median pay_ for the second half of 2022. the _top-paying companies offer salaries ranging from $220,000 to $274,000_ for their entry-level positions (l1).

this gives us a baseline to compare against. let's look at the data for ph.d. holders.

- the **united states census bureau** also conducted several surveys.

  in a community survey from 2009-2011[^11] salaries in computers and mathematics were around $73,000 for a bachelor's degree, $90,000 for a master's degree, and $104,000 for a ph.d – this observation seems to be out of date.

  in another survey[^12] they also studied lifelong earnings. for individuals in computers and mathematics, those with a bachelor's degree earned approximately $3,044,000 over their working life, while _those with a master's degree earned around $3,541,000 and ph.d. holders earned about $3,890,000_. these statistics cover 25 to 64-year-olds who work full-time throughout the year.

this shows that a pay gap exists between ph.d. holders and those with a bachelor's or master's degree. however, it's unclear whether this gap is due to the ph.d. or other factors like the type of job or the company.

- the **national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) / national library of medicine (nlm)**[^13] found that doctoral recipients from eight universities showed variations in earnings based on where they were employed.

  those placed in industry had significantly higher earnings a year after leaving university compared to those in government or academia.

  when looking at the distribution of earnings, doctoral recipients, particularly those employed by research and development (r&d) firms, had higher earnings compared to the average u.s. workforce. a majority of doctoral recipients ended up in academia, while a significant percentage found employment in industry, particularly within r&d performing firms.

this data suggests that ph.d. holders in the industry earn more than those in academia, particularly in r&d firms. this is consistent with the data from levels.fyi, which shows r&d positions in big tech companies pay significantly more than other roles.

<br><br>

# conclusion

in summary, pursuing a phd in computer science can be very beneficial in the north american industry, especially for roles that require strong analytical skills in fields like data science, machine learning, security, or research and development (r&d).

for positions that emphasize leadership or heavy engineering, having a phd will enhance your reputation and likely lead to increased pay.

however, a phd might not be the most efficient route for these roles since it doesn't necessarily equip you with the skills needed for product development, management, sales, responsibility, and leadership. it's much harder to justify pay raises in these positions when competing with other candidates who have more relevant experience.

therefore, deciding whether to pursue a phd should be a decision aimed at securing a specific industry job or position that would otherwise be difficult to attain and aligns well with the skills that you'll gain during your ph.d.
