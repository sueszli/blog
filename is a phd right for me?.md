it’s important to be deliberate and data driven when thinking about your career choices.

ask yourself, "is pursuing a ph.d. the right choice for me?".

the following thought-provoking tips from jimmy lin’s course “asecs” [^1] are a great starting point for some introspection before we start digging into the numbers.

1. **recognise that there are multiple definitions of success and multiple ways to succeed.**

   - set clear goals. define what success means to you by creating your own "utility function" and "success metrics":

     - traditional measures: like total compensation (in the industry) or recognition in the academic community.
     - personal benchmarks: fulfillment, personal and professional growth, freedom, and authority over others.

   - avoid thinking in extremes. consider unconventional paths like writing industry experience papers or using a ph.d. to test business ideas before fully committing.

2. **understand that choices come with opportunity costs.**

   - consider time and money: years spent pursuing a ph.d. or being unemployed mean missing out on paychecks.
   - risk of overspecialization: too much study may make you overqualified for certain positions.
   - mental strain: the competitive nature of academia could overwhelm or exhaust you.

3. **accept the role of skill as well as luck.**

   - no academic degree guarantees success; it only improves your chances if you put in the effort.
   - each ph.d. experience differs due to various factors such as research field, advisors, institution reputation, and location (european ph.d.s are shorter).

4. **think about distributions vs. samples.**

   - be data driven. don't base decisions solely on conversations with successful individuals due to survivorship bias.

5. **reflect on the differences between normative vs. positive approaches.**

   - normative: is your decision influenced by societal norms, personal values, or cultural expectations?
   - positive: does your chosen path offer tangible benefits like career growth, knowledge acquisition, or personal development?

let's start by exploring the first tip and choosing an arbitrary success metric to demonstrate how data-driven decision making would work in practice.

# our metric of choice: total compensation

to be data-driven, we need measurable metrics. however, determining personal success metrics for a career is really hard. here are reasons why i think it's difficult:

- most people don’t know their own metrics.

  it takes a lot of introspection to figure out what you want in your career. personal desires can be overshadowed by societal expectations and wrong assumptions about potential rewards.

- most people don’t like talking about their metrics.

  some are motivated by curiosity and growth, while others are competitive. people may fear being judged for their desires.

- metrics change throughout life.

  with experience, needs change. ie. more experienced individuals might desire personal fulfillment over financial compensation.

the personal metrics we use are basically assumptions based on our intuition, so we should treat them that way.

even if we understand our personal values, desires, and success measures right away, most of them are qualitative (like your well-being) and are harder to measure accurately, although many see them as more important.

that’s why a lot of research focuses on popular, easy-to-measure success metrics like:

- **total compensation:** it’s harder to measure than you might think because it's not just about money. people can get paid in stock options, time off, or reduced workloads, which all contribute to work-life balance. sometimes, they can also use money that they don’t have direct access to, like grant money / funds from investors.

- **outreach and influence/recognition:** this measures how many people you reach and how your work affects them. it's easier to quantify in industries through things like monthly active users or click-through rates. in academia, it might be measured through the number of publications or citations you have (h-index, total citations, etc.) although this is controversial.

to keep things simple, let's focus on total compensation. this brings us to the research question:

> “does getting a phd increase how much money i make compared to someone who doesn’t have a phd?”.

this question is different from where we started (“is a phd right for me?”), but exploring this question serves as a good example of how to our approach can be applied to other questions.

keep in mind that this is just one of many possible metrics and not the primary reason why most computer science ph.d. students pursue their degrees [^2] [^3] [^4].
