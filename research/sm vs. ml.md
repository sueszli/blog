we have two opposing cultures with different assumptions.

_culture 1: statistical modeling SM / data modeling culture_

- assumption: data are generated by a stochastic data model.
- we try to find a matching stochastic data model (ie. linear regression, logistic regression, cox model) that returns the right response variables based on the given predictor variables, random noice, parameters.
  - the conclusions are based on the modelâ€™s outputs, not on that of the nature (original black box we are trying to model).
- model validation: goodness-of-fit tests.

_culture 2: machine learning ML / algorithmic modeling culture_

- assumption: data mechanism is unknown.
- we try to find a function, which is an algorithm that operates on the input data with neural nets / decision trees and tries to predict the response.
- model validation: measured by predictive accuracy.

the author thinks that SM people misunderstand ML people: occam's razor often gets interpreted as "simpler is better". but accuracy (higher interpretability) and simplicity are conflicting goals.

in essence: "an algorithmic model can produce more and more reliable information about the structure of the relationship between inputs and outputs than data models".

## critique

machine learning models aren't necessarily more accurate.

one counter example:

> Christodoulou, E., Ma, J., Collins, G. S., Steyerberg, E. W., Verbakel, J. Y., & Van Calster, B. (2019). A systematic review shows no performance benefit of machine learning over logistic regression for clinical prediction models. Journal of clinical epidemiology, 110, 12-22. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30763612/)

i'm not sure what the takeaway from this paper is.

here's a related (and probably more insightful) post on stackexchange: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning
