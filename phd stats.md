# is a phd really worth it?

a phd is a big decision that can shape your career and life path.

it boils down to your definition of success [^1]:

1. **define success on your terms:**

   - set clear goals and metrics, whether it's about your total compensation or personal fulfillment and growth.
   - think outside the box. consider unconventional paths like collaborating with industry or testing business ideas during your phd.

2. **consider opportunity costs:**

   - time and money are crucial factors. years spent in academia could mean missing out on significant paychecks.
   - watch out for overspecialization, and be mindful of the mental strain that academia can bring.

3. **skill vs. luck:**

   - a phd improves your odds but doesn't guarantee success. your experience will vary based on many factors (research field, advisors, institution reputation, and location)
   - remember, success often requires both skill and luck.

4. **be data-driven:**

   - don't base decisions solely on success stories (survivorship bias). look at the bigger picture and consider various data points.

5. **normative vs. positive approaches:**

   - are your decisions driven by societal norms or tangible benefits that you care about?

but success metrics are hard to define:

- **unclear metrics:** many struggle to define what they truly want from their careers amidst societal pressures and assumptions.

- **reluctance to share:** discussing personal metrics can be uncomfortable due to fear of judgment or competitiveness.

- **evolving priorities:** as you gain experience, your priorities shift. what mattered most earlier might not be the same now.

and most of them are even harder to measure.

one commonly considered and easy to measure metric is the potential compensation growth throughout your career. but that's rarely the reason cs grad students pursue their degree [^2] [^3] [^4].

# paths and probabilities

the computing research association's taulbee survey [^5] provides some insights into the landscape of phd employment in computer science, shedding light on career trajectories and probabilities.

- **only around 2% secure tenure positions:**

     that is, only 7% of the ~30% that actually pursue an academic career which is equivalent to ~2% of all phds.

     there are very few tenure positions compared to the number of ph.d. holders [^6]. the scarcity of tenure positions persists even as the number of ph.d. graduates increases.

     moreover, the allocation of tenure positions isn’t even across different research fields. it leans towards areas that align better with abstract or better-funded tasks like data analysis, ai, or security. this trend is influenced by several factors, including the school attended [^7], the race and gender [^8] of the individuals. it highlights that research institutions don't solely operate based on merit but are also influenced by politics and nepotism.

     additionally to get a tenure-track assistant professor position it is increasingly necessary to do one or more post-docs first.

     but being on the tenure-track is in no way a guarantee of tenure. you might spend your entire career competing and never secure tenure.

- **around ~30% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry:**

     in total (both inside and outside the usa), 69.5% of ph.d. holders pursue careers outside academia, ~38-53% of which are research roles. this means that ~30% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry.

     if only ~30% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry, then ~70% end up with a skill mismatch.

- **over 65% of ph.d. pursuits might be motivated by immigration:**

     approximately 66.9% of computer science phds were awarded to immigrants or nonresident aliens, suggesting that for many, a ph.d. was a pathway to american citizenship via the o1 visa.

     it's noteworthy that 33.1% of the remaining ph.d. holders are non-immigrants, of which 20.1% are white. this shows that phd programs are surprisingly diverse – which is great or a sign of a broken system, depending on your perspective.

- **completion rates are low – but for the wrong reasons:**

     regarding the completion rate, the data is inconclusive: 35% of computer science students at the university of duke [^9] don't complete their phd program.

     but i personally believe that this is due to the fact that it's significantly easier to get funding for a phd than for a master's degree, which motivates students to plan to master out from the beginning.

     i believe that the completion rate of those actually pursuing a phd with the intention of completing their program is much higher.

here's a simplified perspective that also includes the results of the probabilities, assuming they're unconditional:

# salary comparison

finally we try to get some salary data to compare the different paths.

- **median industry earnings:**

     websites like glassdoor and payscale were very wrong about salary information while levels.fyi [^10], one of the most extensive databases available, was very accurate. according to their data from 2022 the median yearly pay for tech jobs is the following:

     - san francisco: $234,000 (1st position)
     - washington d.c.: $148,000 (10th position)
     - overall median ranges from $160,000-$210,000
     - l1 positions at the top-paying faang companies: $220,000-$274,000
     - research scientist positions at the top-paying faang companies: $280,000+ (not enough data)

- **lifelong earnings:**

     the united states census bureau also conducted several surveys.

     in a community survey from 2009-2011[^11] salaries in computers and mathematics were around $73,000 for a bachelor's degree, $90,000 for a master's degree, and $104,000 for a ph.d. but this observation seems to be out of date.

     in another survey[^12] they also studied lifelong earnings. for individuals in computers and mathematics, the following results were found regarding their earnings over their working life (25-64 years, full-time):

     - bachelor's degree: $3,044,000
     - master's degree: $3,541,000
     - ph.d. degree: $3,890,000

     this should be taken with a grain of salt as it's based on a small sample size.

- **r&d earnings (difference unclear):**

     the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) / national library of medicine (nlm)[^13] found that doctoral recipients from eight universities showed variations in earnings based on where they were employed.

     those placed in industry had significantly higher earnings a year after leaving university compared to those in government or academia.

     when looking at the distribution of earnings, doctoral recipients, particularly those employed by research and development (r&d) firms, had higher earnings compared to the average u.s. workforce. a majority of doctoral recipients ended up in academia, while a significant percentage found employment in industry, particularly within r&d performing firms.

the data is inconclusive and it's hard to draw conclusions from it. but it's safe to say that while a ph.d. might not guarantee a higher salary, it does open up the door to higher-paying positions.

# personal takeaways

- **enjoy the journey:**

   life's too short to spend a decade doing something that doesn't make you happy. if you're unsure, try a summer research internship or a master's degree first to see if it's your thing.

- **trust your supervisor:**

   your supervisor decides when you graduate, and sometimes they benefit from keeping you around longer. this can be a problem, especially in north america. consider a european phd for better protections and conditions.

- **amortize the opportunity cost:**

   whether you aim for the tenure lottery or a role in industry research, choose fields, topics, and skills that maximize overlap with industry positions.

   while some topics might seem "too applied" for academic research, you have to make sure that your phd experience translates into years of experience for industry roles that value strong analytical and quantitative skills.

   in general analytical fields naturally provide the greatest overlap between academic and industry work, ensuring a smooth transition if needed.

   other fields, like software and systems engineering, have a significant gap between academic and industry practices. your academic experience may not be fully recognized by industry employers in these cases.
