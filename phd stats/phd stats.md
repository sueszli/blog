# is a phd right for me?

in this post, i'll explore whether a ph.d. in computer science is worth it from a financial perspective based on data from the computing research association's "taulbee survey" [^5] and other sources.

<br><br>

## introduction

to understand whether a ph.d. can contribute to your success, you need to define what success means to you.

the following thought-provoking tips from jimmy lin’s course “asecs” [^1] are a great starting point for some introspection:

1. **recognize that there are multiple definitions of success and multiple ways to succeed.**

      - set clear goals. define what success means to you by creating your own "utility function" and "success metrics":

           - traditional measures: like total compensation (in the industry) or recognition in the academic community.
           - personal benchmarks: fulfillment, personal and professional growth, freedom, and authority over others.

      - avoid thinking in extremes. consider unconventional paths like writing papers in collaboration with the industry or using a ph.d. to test business ideas before fully committing and looking for seed funding.

2. **understand that choices come with opportunity costs.**

      - consider time and money: years spent pursuing a ph.d. or being unemployed mean missing out on almost a million dollars in lost paychecks.
      - risk of overspecialization: too much study may make you overqualified for certain positions.
      - mental strain: the competitive nature of academia could overwhelm or exhaust you.

3. **accept the role of skill as well as luck.**

      - no academic degree guarantees success; it only improves your chances if you put in the effort.
      - each ph.d. experience differs due to various factors such as research field, advisors, institution reputation, and location (european ph.d.s are shorter, but also cause you to start with your thesis later).

4. **think about distributions vs. samples.**

      - be data driven. don't base decisions solely on conversations with successful individuals due to survivorship bias.

5. **reflect on the differences between normative vs. positive approaches.**

      - normative: is your decision influenced by societal norms, personal values, or cultural expectations?
      - positive: does your chosen path offer tangible benefits like career growth, knowledge acquisition, or personal development?

but finding your own definition of success is easier said than done. here are some reasons why i think it's so hard:

- most people don’t know their own metrics.

     it takes a lot of introspection to figure out what you want in your career. personal desires can be overshadowed by societal expectations and wrong assumptions about potential rewards.

- most people don’t like talking about their metrics.

     some are motivated by curiosity and growth, while others are competitive. people may fear being judged for their desires.

- metrics change throughout life.

     with experience, needs change. ie. more experienced individuals might desire personal fulfillment over financial compensation.

but it doesn't end here, the majority of the mentioned metrics are impossible to measure and the ones that are easily measurable are mostly highly inaccurate:

- **total compensation:** people can get paid in benefits such as stock options, time off, or reduced workloads (while keeping the same salary). sometimes, they can also use money that they don’t have direct access to, like grant money / funds from investors.

- **outreach and influence/recognition:** this measures how many people you reach and how your work affects them. it's easier to quantify in industries through things like monthly active users or click-through rates. in academia, it might be measured through the number of publications or citations you have (h-index, total citations, etc.) although this is controversial.

> for the sake of simplicity and finding the greatest common denominator, let's focus on the most easily measurable metric: **total compensation**.

but keep in mind that this is just one of many possible metrics and not the primary reason why most computer science ph.d. students pursue their degrees [^2] [^3] [^4].

## paths and probabilities

the computing research association's "taulbee survey" [^5] offers key insights into our query:

> “The CRA Taulbee Survey is the principal source of information on the […] employment of Ph.D.s in […] computer science […] and in providing salary […] data […] in North America.“

here are the essential findings:

- **only around 2% secure tenure positions:**

     that is, only 7% of the ~30% that actually pursue an academic career which is equivalent to ~2% of all phds.

     there are very few tenure positions compared to the number of ph.d. holders [^6]. the scarcity of tenure positions persists even as the number of ph.d. graduates increases.

     moreover, the allocation of tenure positions isn’t even across different research fields. it leans towards areas that align better with abstract or better-funded tasks like data analysis, ai, or security. this trend is influenced by several factors, including the school attended [^7], the race and gender [^8] of the individuals. it highlights that research institutions don't solely operate based on merit but are also influenced by politics and nepotism.

     additionally to get a tenure-track assistant professor position it is increasingly necessary to do one or more post-docs first.

     but being on the tenure-track is in no way a guarantee of tenure. you might spend your entire career competing and never secure tenure.

- **around ~30% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry:**

     in total (both inside and outside the usa), 69.5% of ph.d. holders pursue careers outside academia, ~38-53% of which are research roles. this means that ~30% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry.

     if only ~30% of ph.d. graduates venture into research roles in the industry, then ~70% end up with a skill mismatch.

- **over 65% of ph.d. pursuits might be motivated by immigration:**

     approximately 66.9% of computer science phds were awarded to immigrants or nonresident aliens, suggesting that for many, a ph.d. was a pathway to american citizenship via the o1 visa.

     it's noteworthy that 33.1% of the remaining ph.d. holders are non-immigrants, of which 20.1% are white. this shows that phd programs are surprisingly diverse – which is great or a sign of a broken system, depending on your perspective.

- **completion rates are low – but for the wrong reasons:**

     regarding the completion rate, the data is inconclusive: 35% of computer science students at the university of duke [^9] don't complete their phd program.

     but i personally believe that this is due to the fact that it's significantly easier to get funding for a phd than for a master's degree, which motivates students to plan to master out from the beginning.

     additionally, it's very hard to get kicked out of a phd program. so, i believe that the completion rate of those actually pursuing a phd with the intention of completing their program is much higher.

here's a simplified perspective that also includes the result of the conditional probabilities:

## salary comparison

finally we try to get some salary data to compare the different paths.

- **median industry earnings:**

     websites like glassdoor and payscale were very wrong about salary information while levels.fyi [^10], one of the most extensive databases available, was very accurate. according to their data from 2022 the median yearly pay for tech jobs is the following:

     - san francisco: $234,000 (1st position)
     - washington d.c.: $148,000 (10th position)
     - overall median ranges from $160,000-$210,000
     - l1 positions at the top-paying faang companies: $220,000-$274,000
     - research scientist positions at the top-paying faang companies: $280,000+ (not enough data)

- **lifelong earnings:**

     the united states census bureau also conducted several surveys.

     in a community survey from 2009-2011[^11] salaries in computers and mathematics were around $73,000 for a bachelor's degree, $90,000 for a master's degree, and $104,000 for a ph.d. but this observation seems to be out of date.

     in another survey[^12] they also studied lifelong earnings. for individuals in computers and mathematics, the following results were found regarding their earnings over their working life (25-64 years, full-time):

     - bachelor's degree: $3,044,000
     - master's degree: $3,541,000
     - ph.d. degree: $3,890,000

     this should be taken with a grain of salt as it's based on a small sample size.

- **r&d earnings (difference unclear):**

     the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) / national library of medicine (nlm)[^13] found that doctoral recipients from eight universities showed variations in earnings based on where they were employed.

     those placed in industry had significantly higher earnings a year after leaving university compared to those in government or academia.

     when looking at the distribution of earnings, doctoral recipients, particularly those employed by research and development (r&d) firms, had higher earnings compared to the average u.s. workforce. a majority of doctoral recipients ended up in academia, while a significant percentage found employment in industry, particularly within r&d performing firms.

the data is inconclusive and it's hard to draw conclusions from it. but it's safe to say that while a ph.d. might not guarantee a higher salary, it does open up the door to higher-paying positions.

## personal takeaways

i believe you should do a phd if:

1. you enjoy the process.

      life is too short to do spend a decade doing something that doesn't bring you joy.

      if you're not sure, try to get a summer research internship or do a master's degree first to find out.

2. you fully trust your advisor.

      they decide when you will graduate and it's in their best interest to keep you as long as possible. it's a conflict of interest and a power dynamic that can be abused.

      this is a common problem in academia and can be slightly mitigated by doing a european phd, which is usually timecapped. you additionally get better salaries and working conditions as you'll be protected by the labor laws of the european union.

      but at the end of the day, you're still at the mercy of your advisor and the university.

3. you can amortize the opportunity cost by meeting one of the following criteria:

      - a) you believe you can be one of the absolute best phd graduates and are studying at a top ~10 school. this way it might make sense to aim for a tenure position although it's still a gamble.

      - b) you believe you can be one of the ~30% best phd graduates and are studying at a top ~30 school. this way you'll have a realistic chance of securing an industry research position.

      - c) you're learning skills that are directly applicable to an industry job, such that your phd experience counts towards your total years of experience when applying for that job.

           this can be a huge advantage as a phd is often a must for leadership roles in big companies (a phd opens up the door to these roles but is not a guarantee. it's a necessary but not sufficient condition).

           but keep in mind that this is only possible for research topics / roles that require strong analytical skills as the academic research process is too different from the industry process otherwise.

           - **good fit:** ai/data science (statistics, machine learning, quantitative finance, combinatorial optimization), security (cryptography and theoretical security), logic and verification (formal methods).

           - **bad fit:** most systems research (operating systems, distributed systems), software engineering research.

           for fields that are a bad fit, a ph.d. can actually make you less employable as you'll be overqualified and underexperienced.
